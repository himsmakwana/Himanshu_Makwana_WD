          <p>=>In HTML, cellpadding and cellspacing are the two attributes used for formatting table cells. Both cellpadding and cellspacing are used to insert whitespaces in the table cells. The most basic difference between cellpadding and cellspacing is that the cellpadding is used to set the whitespace between cell edge and cell content, whereas cellspacing is used to set the whitespace between two cells.</p>
          <h2>Example</h2>
          <table cellpadding="15px" cellspacing="20px">
            <tr><td>xyz</td>
            <td>xyz</td></tr>
            <tr><td>abc</td><td>abc</td></tr>

  <tr>
    <th>Month</th>
    <th>Savings</th>

        <p><strong>11. What is the diffrent between a block level element and an inline element?</strong></p>

        <p>=>A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: < p> and < div>.

The <p > element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

The < div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

        </p> 
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>Here are the block-level elements in </p>
        <p>

<p>An inline element does not start on a new line.

    An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
    
    This is a < span> element inside a paragraph.</p>
    <h2>example</h2>
    <p>a,abbr,acronym,b,bdo,big,br,button,cite,code,dfn,em,i,img,input,kbd,label,map,object,output,q,samp,script,select,small,span,strong,sub,sup,textarea,time,tt,var,p
