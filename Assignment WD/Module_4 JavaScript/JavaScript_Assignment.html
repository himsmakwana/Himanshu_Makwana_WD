      <h1>Assignment JavaScript(Basics & DOM)</h1>
      <div>
        <p>Q-1 =>What is JavaScript?</p>
        <p>
          Ans: JavaScript is the Programming Language for the Web. JavaScript
          can update and change both HTML and CSS. JavaScript can calculate,
          manipulate and validate data.
        </p>
        <p>Q-2=> What is the use of isNaN function?</p>
        <p>
          Ans: isNaN() method returns true if a value is Not-a-Number.
          Number.isNaN() returns true if a number is Not-a-Number. In other
          words: isNaN() converts the value to a number before testing it.
        </p>
        <p>Q-3=>What is negative Infinity?</p>
        <p>
          Ans:The negative infinity in JavaScript is a constant value that is
          used to represent a value that is the lowest available. This means
          that no other number is lesser than this value. It can be generated
          using a self-made function or by an arithmetic operation.
        </p>
        <p>Q-4=>Which company developed JavaScript?</p>
        <p>
          Ans:JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed
          for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. After
          Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation
          continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's
          latest version was 1.8.5. (Identical to ES5).
        </p>
        <p>Q-5=> What are undeclared and undefined variables?</p>
        <p>
          Ans:Undefined variable means a variable has been declared but does not
          have a value. Undeclared variable means that the variable does not
          exist in the program at all.
        </p>
        <p>Q-6=> Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?</p>
        <p>
          Ans:we will be exploring how to add HTML elements dynamically so that
          they could change the view component. Also not just an HTML element,
          we can also add CSS properties to HTML elements with the help of
          JavaScript. In this article, we will be using a button to facilitate
          the addition of an HTML element in the already built template.

                  color: green;
                  display: flex;
                  justify-content: center;
                }
                #mybutton {
                  display: block;
                  margin: 0 auto;
                }

            <body>
              <h1>Welcome To Tutorials Point</h1>
              <div id="innerdiv"></div>
              <button id="mybutton">Click to Add HTML element</button>
              <script>
                document
                  .getElementById("mybutton")
                  .addEventListener("click", function () {
                    document.getElementById("innerdiv").innerHTML +=
                      "<h3>Hello User</h3><p>Start your learning journey today.</p>";
                  });
              </script>
            </body>
          </html>
        </p>
        <p>Q-7=>What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</p>
        <p>
          Ans:- A ViewState is a state of a page within a browser wherein the
          values of controls persist when post back operation is done. When
          another page is loaded, the previous page data is no longer available.
          - SessionState is the data of a user session and is maintained on the
          server side. This data available until user closes the browser or
          session time-outs.
        </p>
        <p>Q-8=> What is === operator?</p>
        <p>
          Ans:The equality operator in javascript is used to compare if two
          values are equal. The comparison is made by == and === operators in
          javascript. The main difference between the == and === operator in
          javascript is that the == operator does the type conversion of the
          operands before comparison, whereas the === operator compares the
          values as well as the data types of the operands.
        </p>
        <p>Q-9=> How can the style/class of an element be changed?</p>
        <p>
          ANs:To change the style of an HTML element, use this syntax:
          document.getElementById(id).style.property = new style The following
          example changes the style of a p elemen.
        </p>
        <p>
          <html>
            <body>
              <p id="p2">Hello World!</p>

              <script>
                document.getElementById("p2").style.color = "blue";
              </script>
            </body>
          </html>
        </p>
        <p>Q-10=> How to read and write a file using JavaScript?</p>
        <p>
          Ans:On the client side, you can’t read or write files in JavaScript
          browsers. The fs module in Node.js may be used to accomplish this on
          the server-side.The fs.readFile() and rs.writeFile() methods are used
          to read and write of a file using javascript. The file is read using
          the fs.readFile() function, which is an inbuilt method.
        </p>
        <p>Syntax: fs.readFile( file_name, encoding, callback_function )</p>
        <p>Q-11=> What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?</p>
        <p>
          Ans:The for statement creates a loop with 3 optional expressions: for
          (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) { // code block to be
          executed } Expression 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of
          the code block. Expression 2 defines the condition for executing the
          code block. Expression 3 is executed (every time) after the code block
          has been executed. for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { text += "The number
          is " + i + "<br />"; }
        </p>
        <p>
          Q-12=> How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in
          JavaScript?
        </p>
        <p>
          Ans:To convert a string to an integer parseInt(), Number(), and Unary
          operator(+) function is used in javascript. parseInt() function
          returns Nan( not a number) when the string doesn’t contain number. If
          a string with a number is sent, then only that number will be returned
          as the output.
        </p>
        <p>Q-13=> What is the function of the delete operator?</p>
        <p>
          ANs:The JavaScript pop(), shift(), or splice() methods are available
          to delete an element from an array. But because of the key-value pair
          in an object, deleting is more complicated. Note that, the delete
          operator only works on objects and not on variables or functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q-14=> What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?
        </p>
        <p>
          Ans:JavaScript has three kind of popup boxes: Alert box, Confirm box,
          and Prompt box.
        </p>
        <p>Q-15=> What is the use of Void (0)?</p>
        <p>
          Ans:The void operator is used to evaluate an expression and returns
          the undefined. Generally, this operator is used for obtaining the
          undefined primitive value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q-16=> How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?
        </p>
        <p>
          Ans:In JavaScript, we can use window.location object to force a page
          to load another page. We can use the location object to set the URL of
          a new page. There are different ways window.location.href property,
          window.location.assign() and window.location.replace() methods, to set
          the URL of a new page using the location object.
        </p>
        <p>
          Q-17=>What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?
        </p>
        <p>
          Ans:Disadvantages of innerHTML Event handlers attached to any DOM
          element are preserved. Replacement is done everywhere. It is not
          possible to append innerHTML. Breaks the document. Used for Cross-site
          Scripting.
