    <h3>Web</h3>
    <p>
The Web is the common name for the World Wide Web, a subset of the Internet consisting of the pages that can be accessed by a Web browser. Many people assume that the Web is the same as the Internet, and use these terms interchangeably</p>
<br>
<h3>WWW</h3>
<p>The World Wide Web is a computer system which links documents and pictures into a database that is stored in computers in many different parts of the world and that people everywhere can use. The abbreviations WWW and the Web are often used.</p>
<br>
<h3>Browser</h3>
<p> a computer program used for accessing sites or information on a network (such as the World Wide Web)</p>
<h3>Address bar</h3>
<p>In a web browser, the address bar is the element that shows the current URL. The user can type a URL into it to navigate to a chosen website</p>
<h3>Title bar</h3>
<p>A title bar is a graphical user interface (GUI) component of a software application or Web page. It holds related metadata and is used to define the name of a window, software or visible interface</p>
<h3>Http</h3>
<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load webpages using hypertext links. HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack. A typical flow over HTTP involves a client machine making a request to a server, which then sends a response message.</p>
<h3>URL</h3>
<p>URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. A URL is nothing more than the address of a given unique resource on the Web. In theory, each valid URL points to a unique resource. Such resources can be an HTML page, a CSS document, an image, etc.</p>
<h3>Extension</h3>
<p>Extensions are software programs, built on web technologies (such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) that enable users to customize the Chrome browsing experience.
</p>
<h3>Editor</h3>
<p>An editor is a person who edits (i.e. makes changes to) documents or audio-visual works. The term can also apply to software and hardware tools used to accomplish such changes.</p>
<h3>Network</h3>
<p>A computer network is a group of computers linked to each other that enables the computer to communicate with another computer and share their resources, data, and applications</p>
<h3>TCP/IP</h3>
<p>TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. TCP/IP is also used as a communications protocol in a private computer network (an intranet or extranet).</p>
<h3>Hosting</h3>
<p>Hosting (also known as Web site hosting, Web hosting, and Webhosting) is the business of housing, serving, and maintaining files for one or more Web sites. More important than the computer space that is provided for Web site files is the fast connection to the Internet.</p>
<h3>Domain</h3>
<p>An internet domain is an administrative structure for organizing, delivering and accessing services on the internet.</p>
<h3>Server</h3>
<p>A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client.</p>
<h3>Client</h3>
<p>Used in home and corporate networks, a client is any computer hardware or software device that requests access to a service provided by a server.
